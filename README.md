# startup-ai
This is a repo for the development of Startup AI

## Technology plan:
To build an interactive web app using the You.com API with features like payments, appointment scheduling, and customer interaction, we have several options for programming languages and technology stacks. This will eventually be a catch-all business platform offering integrations such as google ads analytics and Meta Business Suite integrations and collating the data in one easy to read and understand dashboard. The growth plan is to use that data and a machine learning model to build an online marketing plan customised to each user and help the user adjust spending to Min-Max their advertising budget and save our customers money. Tools to do this may exist already but with startup-ai (potential to change name later) all the tools, analytics, mail tools, marketing tools, customer service tools, business planning tools etc. will all be in one place requiring only one system instead of many which is what the market uses currently. Here's a suggested approach:

### Programming Language: **JavaScript**
- JavaScript is a versatile language that can be used for both frontend and backend development, making it a popular choice for web app development.
- You can use JavaScript frameworks like Node.js for the backend and libraries like React or Vue.js for the frontend to create an interactive user interface.

### Technology Stack:
1. Backend: **Node.js**
   - Node.js is a JavaScript runtime that allows you to build scalable and efficient server-side applications.
   - You can use frameworks like Express.js or Nest.js to handle routing, API endpoints, and business logic.
   - Node.js provides excellent support for asynchronous programming, making it suitable for handling concurrent requests and integrating with external services like the You.com API.

2. Frontend: **React.js**
   - React.js is a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
   - It provides a component-based architecture, making it easy to create reusable UI components and manage state efficiently.
   - React.js works well with JavaScript frameworks like Next.js or Gatsby.js, which provide additional features like server-side rendering or static site generation.

3. Database: **MongoDB**
   - MongoDB is a NoSQL database that offers flexibility and scalability for web applications.
   - It allows you to store and retrieve data in a JSON-like format, which aligns well with JavaScript and JSON-based APIs.
   - MongoDB can be accessed using the official MongoDB Node.js driver or popular ORMs like Mongoose.

4. Payment Integration: **Stripe**
   - Stripe is a widely-used payment processing platform that offers a developer-friendly API for handling payments in web applications.
   - You can integrate Stripe's API into your web app to handle payment transactions securely and efficiently.
   - Stripe provides client libraries for JavaScript that make it easy to interact with their API.

5. Appointment Scheduling: **Zoho Bookings**
   - Zoho Bookings is an appointment scheduling tool that offers features like multi-staff appointments, resource management, and integration with other Zoho apps.
   - You can integrate Zoho Bookings into your web app to handle appointment scheduling and management.
   - Zoho provides APIs and documentation for integrating with their services.
  
The final approach may differ from this initial plan but this is the current advised approach. (Note that pricing is in USD but will be converted based on user geolocation)

1. Basic Tier: This tier can include essential features such as basic customer interaction, limited appointment scheduling, and access to a set of predefined tasks. The price for this tier could range from $10 to $20 per month.

2. Premium Tier: The premium tier can offer advanced features such as personalized customer interactions, advanced appointment scheduling with reminders and notifications, and access to a wider range of tasks and integrations. The price for this tier could range from $30 to $50 per month.

3. Enterprise Tier: The enterprise tier can cater to larger businesses and offer additional features such as custom integrations, priority support, advanced analytics and reporting, and dedicated account management. The price for this tier could range from $100 to $200 per month or more, depending on the complexity and scale of the services provided.

Additionally, consider offering introductory offers or promotional discounts to attract new subscribers and retain existing ones. This can include discounted pricing for the first few months or special offers for specific target segments.

Remember to regularly evaluate and adjust your subscription tiers and pricing based on customer feedback, market trends, and the evolving needs of your target audience.
